  <h6 id="texto1" style="font-size:1.5vw;"> My name is Eduarda Borges. I’m 22 years old (almost 23), and I’m portuguese. I speak portuguese and english fluently. For the time being, I’m doing a master on Design and Multimedia, in the Informatic Engeneering Department from Universidade de Coimbra. Here, I'm concentrating on learning more about UI/UX Design and programming (and to climb the monumental stairs without losing my breath). <p>
      <img src="res/Eu.jpg" class="eu_img"   style="float:left;"/>
Prior to that, I graduated from Universidade Lusófona do Porto with a bachelor's degree in Communication Design, where I began studying design and illustration. I love design, but illustration is my  favorite. So much so that I decided to enroll in the Faculdade de Belas Artes do Porto for a postgraduate program in illustration after completing my bachelor's. There, I learnt more about storytelling and technique tips that I still use today, plus I got to know other fantastic Portuguese illustrators.<p>
Although I'm still new to this experience, I consider myself an illustrator and wish to combine it with other things I'm interested in, like programming. In the future, I also hope to work as a freelance art director and UI/UX designer. Yes, I know. I still have a long journey ahead. But I would be lying if I said I’m not excited about it. I appreciate you being here. I hope you'll stick around to see what I'll be able to do. <p>
Maybe I should speak more about the interesting parts of myself, so you can see I’m not a robot. Well… I perform well under pressure, and I have so many ideas that I can't stop daydreaming and sketching about them. <p>
I also have an alter ego. I think you’ve met them. Their name is Dudz. Dudz is the creative force behind all of my concepts and inventions. They love coffee. They also love sleep (although they can never get it enough) and, most importantly, they will be delighted to work with you!
